### **Project Explanation**

#### **1. Key Components**
- **Encoding Modules:**
  The project employs transformer-based encoders (`encoders.py`) for extracting features from protein and SMILES sequences. These models integrate positional encoding and convolutional refinement to ensure the representations are suitable for sequence alignment and generation tasks.

- **Decoding Modules:**
  Using decoders (`decoders.py`), the project supports sequence generation. The SMILES decoder reconstructs chemical compounds, while the Protein decoder generates sequences for various applications, including testing and validation.

- **Training Framework:**
  The `inference_smiles.py` script integrates protein and SMILES embeddings into a comprehensive training pipeline. This includes pre-trained protein encoders, learning rate schedulers, and utilities for managing complex datasets like BindingDB.

- **Contrastive Learning:**
  The `PCL.py` module ensures embeddings from the protein and SMILES encoders reside in a shared latent space, enhancing their biological interpretability.

#### **2. Data Sources**
- **BindingDB:** Used for extracting protein and ligand binding affinity data.
- **Pre-trained Tokenizers:** Incorporates `ChemBERTa` and `ProtBERT` tokenizers for SMILES and protein sequences.

#### **3. Applications**
- **Drug Discovery:** Predict interactions between candidate drugs and target proteins.
- **Protein Function Prediction:** Leverage protein embeddings for functional annotation tasks.
- **Sequence Alignment:** Align protein and SMILES embeddings for understanding biochemical interactions.
- **Novel Compound Generation:** Generate novel SMILES sequences conditioned on specific protein structures.

#### **4. Methodology**
